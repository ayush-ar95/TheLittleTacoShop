# "HTML Project"

Built a website for 'The Little Taco Shop'.

** Directions **
- There are three files: index.html, hours.html, contact.html
- There is minimal CSS available in css/styles.css. Just need to link that file to the HTML files.
- All images are provided in the img folder.
- A favicon is included. Just need to add it in the head section of each page.
